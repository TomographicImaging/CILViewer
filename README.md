# CILViewer
A simple Viewer for 3D data built with VTK and Python.
There are two versions:
- GUI built with Python Qt
- Web viewer, built with trame

The viewers can also be embedded into any Qt application.
An example of use of the viewers in another app is the [iDVC app](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/iDVC)

## Install instructions
To install via `conda`, create a new environment using:
<!-- VERSION_MARKER -->
```bash
conda create --name cilviewer ccpi-viewer=24.0.1 -c ccpi -c conda-forge
```
<!-- VERSION_MARKER -->


## Running the CILViewer app

- Activate your environment using: ``conda activate cilviewer``.
- Launch by typing: `cilviewer`
- Load a dataset using the File menu. Currently supported data formats:
  - HDF5, including Nexus
  - Raw
  - Tiff
  - Numpy
  - Metaimage (mha and mhd)

## Using the 2D and 3D Viewers

### **2D Viewer**
### Keybindings
The interactive viewer CILViewer2D provides:
  - Keyboard Interactions:
    - 'h' display the help
    - 'x' slices on the YZ plane
    - 'y' slices on the XZ plane
    - 'z' slices on the XY
    - 'a' auto window/level to accomodate all values
    - 's' save render to PNG (current_render.png)
    - 'l' plots horizontal and vertical profiles of the displayed image at the pointer location
    - 'i' toggles interpolation
  - slice up/down: mouse scroll (10 x pressing SHIFT)
  - Window/Level: ALT + Right Mouse Button + drag
  - Pan: CTRL + Right Mouse Button + drag
  - Zoom: SHIFT + Right Mouse Button + drag (up: zoom in, down: zoom out)
  - Pick: Left Mouse Click
  - ROI (square): 
    - Create ROI: CTRL + Left Mouse Button 
    - Resize ROI: Left Mouse Button on outline + drag
    - Translate ROI: Middle Mouse Button within ROI
    - Delete ROI: ALT + Left Mouse Button

### **3D Viewer**
### Keybindings
The interactive 3D viewer CILViewer provides:
  - Keyboard Interactions:
    - 'h' display the help
    - 'x' slices on the YZ plane
    - 'y' slices on the XZ plane
    - 'z' slices on the XY
    - 'r' save render to current_render.png
    - 's' toggle visibility of slice
    - 'v' toggle visibility of volume render
    - 'c' activates volume render clipping plane widget, for slicing through a volume.
    - 'a' whole image Auto Window/Level on the slice.
    - 'i' interpolation of the slice.
  - Slice: Mouse Scroll
  - Zoom: Right Mouse + Move Up/Down
  - Pan: Middle Mouse Button + Move or Shift + Left Mouse + Move
  - Adjust Camera: Left Mouse + Move
  - Rotate: Ctrl + Left Mouse + Move
