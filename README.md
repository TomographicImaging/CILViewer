# CILViewer
A simple interactive viewer based on VTK classes and written in Python.
- The classes in [`viewer`](Wrappers/Python/ccpi/viewer/) define generic viewers that can be embedded in [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) or other user interfaces. [`CILViewer2D`](Wrappers/Python/ccpi/viewer/CILViewer2D.py) is a 2D viewer and [`CILViewer`](Wrappers/Python/ccpi/viewer/CILViewer.py) is a 3D viewer. 
- The classes in [`web viewer`](Wrappers/Python/ccpi/web_viewer/) define a viewer embedded in [trame](https://kitware.github.io/trame/).

Examples of QApplications are the [`iviewer`](Wrappers/Python/ccpi/viewer/iviewer.py) and the [`standalone viewer`](Wrappers/Python/ccpi/viewer/standalone_viewer.py). An example of use in an external software is [iDVC](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/iDVC).

## Installation instructions
To install via `conda`, create a **minimal** environment using:

```bash
conda create --name cilviewer ccpi-viewer=24.0.1 -c ccpi -c conda-forge
```
### Qt embedding

To embed the viewer in Qt applications we provide extra [UI utilities](Wrappers/Python/ccpi/viewer/ui). To use those, the environment needs to include the extra requirements `eqt>=2.0.0` and one Python-Qt binding, such as `PySide2`, `PySide6` or `PyQt5`. The [UI examples](Wrappers/Python/examples/ui_examples) require `cil-data` as well. 

The environment can be updated to include these (`pyside2`) dependencies as follows:
```sh
conda env update --name cilviewer --file Wrappers/Python/conda-recipe/ui_env.yml
```

## Run the standalone viewer QApplication

- Activate your environment using: ``conda activate cilviewer``.
- Launch by typing: `cilviewer`
- Load a dataset using the File menu. Currently supported data formats:
  - HDF5, including Nexus
  - Raw
  - Tiff
  - Numpy
  - Metaimage (mha and mhd)
